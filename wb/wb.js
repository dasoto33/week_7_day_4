//  You've probably seen those intriguing paragraphs where the inner letters of each word are scrambled, 
// but the first and last letters are in place. Readers surprisingly comprehend such texts with relative ease. 
// Inspired by this phenomenon, we will create a function that generates text in a similar pattern. However, 
// instead of scrambling the inner letters, our function will sort them alphabetically!

// Task:

// Your task is to create a function that takes a string and returns a modified string where:

// The first and last characters of each word stay in their original positions.
// The characters between the first and last characters of each word are sorted alphabetically.

// Assumptions:

// For the purpose of this task, make the following assumptions:

// Words are separated by single spaces.

// Ignore the capitalization when sorting the letters, but maintain the original capitalization in 
// the output string.
